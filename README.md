# ðŸ¥¤ Jugnu Soda â€“ QR-Based Ordering Website

A responsive and user-friendly website designed for a food & beverage business. Customers can scan a QR code to instantly access the menu, place orders online, and streamline the dining experience â€” all without an app. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and hosted via GitHub Pages.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Features
- Mobile-optimized, clean UI for easy ordering  
- QR code integration for instant menu access  
- Smooth, intuitive customer journey from scan to checkout  
- Razorpay payment integration can be added if needed

## ðŸš§ Note
Payment functionality is not enabled because Razorpay requires an FSSAI certificate, which is only issued to registered food businesses. Since I do not own a business, I do not have the certificate. However, I can fully implement Razorpay integration if needed for a client or live business.
